I always made stuff, like a lot of kids it started with legos and never stopped since. Coding tools is like finding the correct lego to make that new object more realistic, colourful or resistant. I always hacked on stuff and tried to make things. It was rewarding to make something that works. Even if it was just small scripts, apps or hacks that made only my life easier. 

When I started using ruby, a brand new world opened to me. I could hack for me in a new easy way. I was using mostly Java before that. Ruby also opened me to a community of great makers. It was also the time when I discovered the joys of coding for others through open source contributions and pull requests. It was like adding your own block to someone else creation, helping them to make it more beautiful and resistant than ever.

After that, I worked for clients in a consultancy agency and in a startup, I understood the part I prefer in coding. It was not always the main feature. It was those little scripts, those little apps that makes someone else life easier, that someone else could be me. Coding tools for other people was my favorite part of the job. Even just a right SQL query could be rewarding and so helpful. I really discovered that crafting those solutions for other developers was one of the most rewarding work a developer can do. Inventing new blocks to change the game.

This is the reason I'm so happy to join the tools team at heroku. I'll be able to provide new blocks to those amazingly skilled developers. 

**Coding is just playing with blocks.**
