Just a short post about food, ruby and the belgian community.

A few months ago, we started [Ruby_burgers](http://www.meetup.com/ruby_burgers-rb/) in Brussels with [Marc Lainez](http://twitter.com/mlainez). It's a ruby event where we eat a burger and chitty chat about Ruby and development. Two soldout out editions later, and here come the little brothers of this event.

In LiÃ¨ge, we have [Ruby_boulets](//ruby_boulets.eventbrite.com) organized by [Laurent Sansonetti](//twitter.com/lrz).

And in Ghent, there will be [Ruby_Ribs](http://rubyribs.eventbrite.com/) organized by [Tom Maeckelberghe](//twitter.com/maeckelberghe).

I'm so proud of this Belgian community and hope these events will stay fun and full.

Don't hesitate to join us or create some food related event in your city.
