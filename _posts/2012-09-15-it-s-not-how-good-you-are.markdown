I just read a great book about self motivation and how good you need to be!

It's a bestseller I bought at urban outfitters (not ashamed).
But you can find it on [amazon](http://www.amazon.fr/Its-Not-How-Good-Want/dp/0714843377)

The title **It's Not How Good You Are , It's How Good You Want To Be** by Paul Arden

It's really great to think a little bit where you are and where you want to go.
I can't recommend it enough. It took my like 2 hours max to read it but I'll start it again to be sure!
