I just added a [new experiment](http://coffi.yannick.io) I made with rails and the foursquare API.
The aim of this application is to let you find bars with a wifi connection good enough to work for an hour or more.
I tried to make it fast and easy so that you have an easy way to rate the wifi connection and give the password.

If you have any advice, feature/request idea or problem, don't hesitate to drop a tweet or a message.

For some technical details, it's a rails 3.2.6 app with mongodb and mongoid 3.0.1.
