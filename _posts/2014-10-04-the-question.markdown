Last week at [Arrrrcamp][1], a ruby conference in Belgium, I met a bunch of great people. A lot of the European rubyists had only one question.

**"How did you get hired by [Heroku][2]?"**.

Is it about working for a foreign company or the company itself? I don't know. A majority of Europeans seem to think that you can only be hired by European companies.

## What did I do?

It was as easy as going to [jobs.heroku.com][3] and finding the exciting job opportunity that was a fit for me. Yes, it was that simple.

Ok, there was a bit more than that. I was a client of Heroku through personal projects and [frontback][4], where I was working. I also was developing things using their API. And turns out I was using beta features in a project and some Herokais liked it. I also met some Herokais in various conferences.

But in the end, the only thing that matters here is that I applied. **And you can too**.

## What did Heroku do?

Application was out, it was time to stress. I would have accepted a "No". After some days, I received an email from the tools team's manager saying that my profile was interesting.

A first hangout was planned, I was super excited. And I stressed for nothing as it was one of the more pleasant discussion I had for a job interview. A few other hangouts were planned with different people inside the company; the platform architect, a ruby specialist and some of the people from the team. It felt more like smalltalk than real complex interviews, but I actually answered a lot of questions without knowing it.

It was obvious to me this was the company I wanted to work for. The last step was a starter project, a small project with the team to see if you and the team are compatible. It turned out great, and after that, I had purple in my mind.

And that was it, I was a **Herokai**.

## TL;DR

As a coworker said when I told him about this question:

*"You applied, You were awesome and that's about it."*
