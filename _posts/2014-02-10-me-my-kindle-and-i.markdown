In december, my amazing girlfriend offered me a kindle paperwhite. I wanted one for more than a year.
I love to read, but during the last year, I did not managed to read novels and non technical books other than comics.
Keeping all the books in our appartment has becoming a problem. We have a nice comics collection and some novels and technical books.

For most of the technical books, I read them and forget the book. Sometimes I need to quickly search in them and that’s when a PDF is better than a paper version. This might be a personal project of 2014. An indexer of all my ebooks.

Back to the kindle, as a commuter, I want to carry all my current readings with me. And I don’t want it to hurt my back. This is my user story and amazon with the kindle solve that problem.
Another problem I had, is the ease of reading. I was using my iPad mini for that purpose before and reading in bed was not comfortable at all. I’m quite often reading in the dark while my girlfriend is sleeping next to me and the light of the iPad is too strong.

Thanks to the kindle, I also started reading novels in English. I’m lying I bought a novel in english before (*The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared* A really great novel)…  I want to be better in english and my vocabulary needs new words. Novels are a great way for that. And in paper version I was always with my dictionary to be sure I understand some words. An amazing feature of the kindle is the inner dictionary you can activate just by tapping a word. It is really useful and helps me a lot.

After reading that novel, I started reading the Millenium trilogy and it’s really pleasant to read novels on the kindle. I plan to continue read more and more novels. At some times, I will start with english writers. For the moment, I see that the novels I read are mostly from Nordic countries in Europe… Maybe the text is easier to understand for me.

Since I got that device, I bought about ten technical books thanks to [pragprog](http://pragprog.com/), [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) and [o’reilly](www.oreilly.com). They have great deals for ebooks. I’m always reading more than a book at the time. Not sure if it is a correct way to deal with books. I need to focus more. But all the great deals and my reading list is so long that I sometimes just read part of books. I buy some books just to support folks I admire. The best part of it is that they are ‘integrated’ with my kindle. As soon as I buy an ebook, it is sent to a special email address that means “add it to the kindle”.

You can also easily add a workflow with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) and [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com). I have a [receipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/139429) that watch a folder on dropbox and email each file I add there to my kindle. Having new pdfs and ebooks direct to my kindle has never been so easy. I’m also an heavy [instapaper](http://instapaper.com) user, And you can easily have a readable version of blog posts sent directly to the kindle, or all the unread articles bookmarked today sent in once.

I love the format of the kindle it makes an amazing companion for technical books. Even code is really readable there. I hate page numbering in books. Don’t ask me why but I prefer nothing than 100 pages left to read. And kindle shows you multiple possibilities. Time left is the worst as I’m a bad english reader. The autonomy of the device is also quite great. Being able to read a few weeks without charging it is a must. You can of course adapt the luminosity. The interface is simple but yet practical. It’s easy to search an ebook on amazon and buying it with one click. This device is a must have for all folks that enjoy reading.

P.S.: I still really love paper books, the smell, the feeling and all that.
