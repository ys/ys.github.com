Last week, the [betacowork](http://betacowork.com) was hosting the first Brussels'
Openhack Meetup.

There were about 30 hackers coding in Ruby, Python, Objective-C, Javascript, C# and probably more!
I'm so proud to have launched this awesome event in Brussels!

And it will be a monthly event, so if you want to join, I can't wait for the next one.

Just watch the [openhack page](http://openhack.github.io/brussels)
or join the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openhack-brussels)

It wouldn't have been possible without sponsors that provided pizzas and beers!

The sponsors:
[Betacowork](http://betacowork.com), [Betagroup](http://betagroup.be), [postponeApp](http://postponeapp.com) & [Shopigram](http://shopigram.com)
