I started watching new screencasts!
Finished the codeschool and railscasts for the moment.

[Rubytapas](http://devblog.avdi.org/rubytapas/) are short screencasts about ruby goodness and advanced techniques.
[Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com) Great screencats about development techniques for serious developers.

And don't forget [Thoughtbot podcasts](http://www.thoughtbot.com/podcast), greatness with Ben Orenstein.

That's all for today.
