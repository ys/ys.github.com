It's Christmas Eve and I take a quick look back at 2012.
This year was awesome. It was full of challenges, learning and other great stuffs.

You can take a look at [that checkthis poster](http://checkthis.com/2012-in-12-pictures) to have a quick overview of the year. But in a few words, full ruby day job (thanks to [belighted](http://belighted.com)), moving to Brussels, a fianc√©e and a lot of conferences.

I learned a lot about technologies this year but also about myself. And with that in mind, I can change everything again in 2013. Some changes are already there.

I go back to product development with [checkthis](http://checkthis.com) and will do probably some freelance jobs over the year. But as some said, it's just going back to **my first ruby love**.
I will keep learning as always. I want to try new languages, frameworks and other great stuffs. You can leave a suggestion.


I have my **wedding** to organize and more travels to do. That will be amazing and challenging. That will be hard too, but it's for the best.

I need to go back to some conferences. That was awesome to meet all that guys from the community. The fun I had with those guys is just pure happiness.

I will probably be at some of those:

* [Railsberry](http://railsberry.com/), the Rails conference not about Rails.
* [Euruko](http://euruko2013.org/), the Ruby conference that organizers decided to organize the day before the votes.
* [La conf](http://2013.la-conf.org/), the Ruby and Rails conference for the gourmets.
* [#inspect](http://www.rubymotion.com/conference/), the Rubymotion conference with local beers right on the Grand Place of Brussels.
* And so many more, I hope to attend. (All in this list aren't sure for the moment.)

**I just can promise you one thing, 2013 is gonna be a great year for me.**
