While I started to read Codeship [Blog](http://blog.codeship.io/2013/08/16/the-codeship-workflow-part-1-developing-a-new-feature.html)'s posts about their workflow.
I thought it would be clever to write down my current workflow applied for [Frontback](http://frontback.me).
Which is also my workflow now in other small personnal projects.
1 Discuss GitHub issues
2 Git Workflow
3 Codeship

5 New Relic and AppSignal optimizations
