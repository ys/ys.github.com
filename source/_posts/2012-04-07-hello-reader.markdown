Who the hell are you? Why are you blogging in 2011?

I'm a 27th year old guy from Belgium. I fell in love with Internet in 1996… And never stopped. And this year, I started to live a **dream**!

Firstly, after a trip to San Francisco, I met [**@checkthis**](http://checkthis.com) people. And integrated the team as a backend Ruby on Rails developper (We are three people in the team).

Secondly, I started to work exclusively for the Internet. I stopped Java and started Ruby in a new full time job. I joined [**@belighted**](http://www.belighted.com) team in mid of november 2011. I hope we will do great things together. I really like the mind and spirit of this team.

And that's why I start blogging in 2011. I really enjoy the beginning of my new life. Even if for the moment, I have to take the train for a 1h30 min trip in the morning and same in the evening. But you know… That's temporary and force me to see if all of this is really made for me. I have to say that it's ok for the moment. I can work in the train or write something.

So there it is, hope to see you again soon and share a lot with you.
