Hello people!

Today I wanted to share with you a small thing I made quickly today to help me later.

I made a [github repository](http://github.com/ys/sinatra_skeleton) with a default sinatra app.

It has everything you need to bootstrap a sinatra project.
I had to start a project last week and i thougt it would be great to extract what I learned from that one.

Gems used: Pg (Database), ActiveRecord (Models), Slim (Views) and Rabl (Json)

For the tests : Rspec, Rack-test, Factory_girl, Faker, Shoulda, Database_cleaner, Json_spec

I added a few gems really useful like :

- Shotgun (Auto reload project at changes)
- Tux (sort of rails console)
- Guard-Rspec (Auto launch changed specs)


If you don't know them, have a look!

Don't hesitate to leave a comment or issues about ideas or problems you find in these project.
