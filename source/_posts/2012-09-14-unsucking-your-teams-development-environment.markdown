Last week-end, I was at [Baruco](http://baruco.org). Really great time.
Zach Holman from Github gave a really great talk about automation, processes and productivity.


> Success can lead to less-glamorous problems, though.
> As you grow, your team's development environment becomes really important.
> How long does it take to clone, set up, and boot your apps?
> Can your employees still be productive on an aging codebase?
> How can you automate CI, hooks, and other setup for new projects? Is any of this fun anymore?
